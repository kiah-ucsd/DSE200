I am the type of person who recognizes great films even if I do not like the genre. This is the first movie I could not stand to watch. Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I have ever seen--and I've seen a lot of movies. The acting is okay (Myers is good as the cat, it's just that he is REALLY annoying). The silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous, even for the children in the audience. The plot drags on and on, and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue. The \\\"witty\\\" parental remarks are disgusting, not funny (I remember some awful comment about a garden hoe being compared to, well, a type of person people call a \\\"ho\\\"). Even though the movie is really short, it seemed to last FOREVER. Do not waste your time. I know small kids who hated this movie. If children can't stand it, I do not know how any adults can. I would like to fume more about this film but I do not even feel like wasting anymore time writing this review about it. I HATED IT! So, in summary, do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this! See a GOOD movie!<br /><br />1/10 stars--the lowest review I have ever given a movie.\",\n          \"it's the best film that takes the first place at the sickest and an useful films ever made in this poor country. really u people even don't know what the word cinema means and u cast votes for movies, i'm really curious to know how many movies of P.P.P. or L.Bunuel have u seen. The score of this \\\"faield experiment\\\" it reflects a lot of u're way of understanding things and to recognize a good/quality movie when u see it. We the Romanian people have only ONE movie and until this day the status hasn't change & that movie is \\\"Padurea Spanzuratilor\\\". But I don't lose my time thinking how many of you have seen it. That is a movie that respects all the required quality's's of an MOVIE. From the script to the frames and even to the quality/clarity of the picture even are past over him 41 years. I recommend to the voters to search for better movies and then vote. KuDos will See u later .\",\n          \"\\\"Rush in Rio\\\" is, no doubt, one of the most exciting DVDs I have purchased. Although I am a biased Rush fan of almost 20 years, I found this performance to be flawless. The music is heavy and sharp (which sounds great on any surround sound system), the band is energetic, the crowd has a constant smile... it's like they were able to capture every concert I've been to. For any Rush fan, this DVD is a must; if anything, just to see the \\\"Boys in Brazil\\\" documentary (which reveals the travels of this rather isolated, personal band). For any non-Rush fan, this DVD is an enjoyable concert. Rush fans know the talent of these three Canadians. We have rather firmly stood by them for years. I've shown this DVD (or portions of it, anyway) to those who have never heard of Rush, or those who think Rush is less than good because they do not appeal to the pessimistic masses of rock (i.e., sex, drugs, and a drunken frenzy). The bottom line is this DVD is worth every penny and more than worth the time to view it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

I thought that it was refreshing to see something that was willing to go to a level of near-taboo twisted comedy.<br /><br />Wirey Spindell is a great film with great dialog. I wouldn't say that this film is for everyone, but the film is on my top 10 list.<br /><br />If you can look beyond it's occasional offensiveness and watch it for the film that it is, I would hope you could see it in the same light that I do.\",\n          \"This film is strictly for fans of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher.<br /><br />I get angry at TCM for showing this mess more frequently than Bachelor Mother, the delightful original. I get angrier still that some Hollywood boob thought it would be a good idea to remake Bachelor Mother, filling it with some lame songs that only serve to interrupt the flow of a cute comedy. Instead, Hollywood could have spent the time, money, energy and talent wasted on this horrible remake to give us something new and original - Wow, what a concept!<br /><br />Bachelor Mother (the original), with Ginger Rogers and David Niven is a spicy stew, simmering with sexuality. It is a 1930's wink at the Hays Office. Bundle of Joy (the remake), with Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher is strictly milk and cookies. It is a 1950's handshake with Eisenhower.<br /><br />Which cast would you rather watch - Debbie Reynolds, Eddie Fisher and Adolphe Menjou, or Ginger Rogers, David Niven and Charles Coburn? For me, every member of the cast in the original version is far better than his/her counterpart in the remake.<br /><br />In the original a beautiful, young Ginger Rogers is at her peak. David Niven delivers perfectly as a somewhat spoiled, sophisticated and yet befuddled scion of a wealthy department store magnate. And I always love to see Charles Coburn in a movie. In Bachelor Mother, he is priceless as the desperate grandfather wannabe.<br /><br />In Bundle of Joy Debbie Reynolds is her usual perky self. She is fine in this role, although her performance (along with Fisher's) completely changes the tone of the story. As an actor, Eddie Fisher is hopeless. He is completely lacking in screen \\\"presence.\\\" Here he is way too wholesome for this story. His acting is completely bland and clueless. Likewise, his singing is so bland and unremarkable that it has been completely forgotten by the world at large. The only time he is not completely painful is in Butterfield 8 - where, incidentally, he doesn't sing. Here, Fisher's lame performance alone is enough to ruin this movie. Adolphe Menjou, a favorite character actor, delivers a competent performance, but not one of his best. He is more blustering than commanding. He and Fisher are not convincing as a father and son.<br /><br />Do you see a musical for the music, the story being merely incidental? Or do watch a musical for a story, with some (hopefullly) good music used for seasoning? If the former, you might like this lame remake. Otherwise you are much better off watching the Ginger Rogers non-musical original, Bachelor Mother.\",\n          \"This is a movie, that has all the basic elements of its genre. It makes you wanna cry, it makes you laugh, it disgust you, it makes you angry etc. <br /><br />The topic of the story is fortunately not about some disease or drugs, what is the common trend in gay themed movies in these days, but it focuses on the social interactions between characters what could be considered not to be in the high school elite. The play and the direction could be a little bit more sophisticated, but on the other hand it's somehow better so, because it really shows the distress of the characters, that they are experiencing. If this was intended, then this is a remarkable job and assuredly an achievement, specially for such an young director. <br /><br />It's actually a good story that gives you a little inside into, how it is to be a fat girl and to acknowledge it to yourself.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 500,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"though several scenes of wirey spindell can be described as over the top i thought that it was refreshing to see something that was willing to go to a level of neartaboo twisted comedywirey spindell is a great film with great dialog i wouldnt say that this film is for everyone but the film is on my top 10 listif you can look beyond its occasional offensiveness and watch it for the film that it is i would hope you could see it in the same light that i do\",\n          \"this film is strictly for fans of debbie reynolds and eddie fisheri get angry at tcm for showing this mess more frequently than bachelor mother the delightful original i get angrier still that some hollywood boob thought it would be a good idea to remake bachelor mother filling it with some lame songs that only serve to interrupt the flow of a cute comedy instead hollywood could have spent the time money energy and talent wasted on this horrible remake to give us something new and original  wow what a conceptbachelor mother the original with ginger rogers and david niven is a spicy stew simmering with sexuality it is a 1930s wink at the hays office bundle of joy the remake with debbie reynolds and eddie fisher is strictly milk and cookies it is a 1950s handshake with eisenhowerwhich cast would you rather watch  debbie reynolds eddie fisher and adolphe menjou or ginger rogers david niven and charles coburn for me every member of the cast in the original version is far better than hisher counterpart in the remakein the original a beautiful young ginger rogers is at her peak david niven delivers perfectly as a somewhat spoiled sophisticated and yet befuddled scion of a wealthy department store magnate and i always love to see charles coburn in a movie in bachelor mother he is priceless as the desperate grandfather wannabein bundle of joy debbie reynolds is her usual perky self she is fine in this role although her performance along with fishers completely changes the tone of the story as an actor eddie fisher is hopeless he is completely lacking in screen presence here he is way too wholesome for this story his acting is completely bland and clueless likewise his singing is so bland and unremarkable that it has been completely forgotten by the world at large the only time he is not completely painful is in butterfield 8  where incidentally he doesnt sing here fishers lame performance alone is enough to ruin this movie adolphe menjou a favorite character actor delivers a competent performance but not one of his best he is more blustering than commanding he and fisher are not convincing as a father and sondo you see a musical for the music the story being merely incidental or do watch a musical for a story with some hopefullly good music used for seasoning if the former you might like this lame remake otherwise you are much better off watching the ginger rogers nonmusical original bachelor mother\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.9576069448657892,\n        \"min\": -0.999805748462677,\n        \"max\": 0.9998733997344971,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 500,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.9994940757751465,\n          -0.9762498140335083\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
