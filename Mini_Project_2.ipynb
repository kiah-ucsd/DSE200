        "Discount offers lead by a wide margin. Customers respond more consistently to simple, upfront savings compared to BOGO or informational offers.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Reward vs. Completion Rate, Difficulty, and Duration:\n",
        "The $2 reward offer is an interesting outlier — it’s the hardest to complete and lasts the longest, yet it still has one of the highest success rates. That suggests people are willing to take on a challenge if the reward feels within reach.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Customer Demographics: Age and Income:\n",
        "Most customers are in their 50s and typically earn between $50K–$90K a year. This mid-career segment likely values consistency and practical benefits, making them strong candidates for loyalty-driven or savings-based campaigns.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Offer Engagement by Gender:\n",

        "2. Mid-career adults form the core of the customer base, with high responsiveness to practical rewards.\n",
